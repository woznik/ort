# The `.ort.yml` file

The items below can be configured by adding an `.ort.yml` file
to the root of the source code repository.

* [excludes](#excludes) - Mark [files, directories](#excluding-paths)
  or [package manager scopes](#excluding-scopes) as not included in released artifacts.
* [license finding curations](#curations): Overwrite scan results to correct identified licenses.
* [resolutions](#resolutions) - Resolve any issues or policy rule violations.

The sections below explain each in further detail. Prefer to learn by example? See the [.ort.yml](../.ort.yml)
for OSS Review Toolkit itself.

## Excludes

### When to Use Excludes

Excludes are used to define which OSS is distributed to third parties and which code is only used internally,
e.g. for building, documenting or testing the code. 

Exclusions apply to paths (files/directories) or scopes. Examples of currently supported exclusions:

* all dependencies defined in ./test/pom.xml in Maven-based projects.
* dependencies in scopes ‘test’ or ‘provided’.

### Excludes Basics

ORT's philosophy is to analyze and scan everything it can find to build a complete picture of a repository
and its dependencies.

However, the users may not be interested in the results for components that are not included in their released
artifacts, for example build files, documentation, examples or test code. To support such use cases, ORT provides a
mechanism to mark files, directories or scopes included in the repository as excluded.

Note that the excluded parts are analyzed and scanned, but are treated differently in the reports ORT generates:

* The issue summary does not show issues in the excluded parts.
* The excluded parts are grayed out.
* The reason for the exclusion is shown next to the result.

To be able to show why a part is excluded, each exclude must include an explanation.
The explanation consists of:

* `reason` -- must be selected from a predefined list of options.
* `comment` -- free text that provides an optional explanation.

### Excluding Paths

Path excludes are used to mark a complete path as excluded.

The code below shows the structure of a path exclude in the `.ort.yml` file:

```yaml
excludes:
  paths:
  - pattern: "A glob pattern matching files or paths."
    reason: "One of PathExcludeReason e.g. BUILD_TOOL_OF, DOCUMENTATION_OF or TEST_OF."
    comment: "A comment further explaining why the path is excluded."
```

Where the list of available options for `reason` is defined in
[PathExcludeReason.kt](../model/src/main/kotlin/config/PathExcludeReason.kt).
For how to write a glob pattern, please see this
[tutorial](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/essential/io/fileOps.html#glob).

The path exclude above has the following effects:

* All projects found below the `test-data` directory are marked as excluded.
* License findings in files below the `test-data` directory are marked as excluded. This can be used in
  [evaluator rules](getting-started.md#6-running-the-evaluator) to for instance change the severity from error to
  warning.

```yaml
excludes:
  paths:
  - pattern: "test-data/**"
    reason: "TEST_OF"
    comment: "This directory contains test data which are not distributed."
```

### Excluding Scopes

Many package managers support grouping of dependencies by their use. Such groups are called `scopes` in ORT.
For example, Maven provides the scopes `compile`, `provided`, and `test`, while NPM scopes are `dependencies` and
`devDependencies`.

You can use regular expressions for `pattern` to match the scopes to exclude.
This can be useful, for example, with Gradle, which creates a relatively large number
of scopes (internally Gradle calls them `configurations`).

Scopes excludes always apply to all found projects in a scan.

```yaml
excludes:
  scopes:
  - pattern: "test.*"
    reason: "TEST_DEPENDENCY_OF"
    comment: "Packages for testing only."
```

The above example excludes all of the following scopes for all projects: `testAnnotationProcessor`,`testApi`,
`testCompile`, `testCompileClasspath`, `testCompileOnly`, `testImplementation`, `testRuntime`, `testRuntimeClasspath`,
`testRuntimeOnly`.

Where the list of available options for scopes is defined in
[ScopeExcludeReason.kt](../model/src/main/kotlin/config/ScopeExcludeReason.kt).

See the examples below for typical scope excludes for the supported package managers.
Note that you must verify that the scopes defined in the examples below match the scopes in your project.

* [bower.ort.yml](./examples/bower.ort.yml)
* [bundler.ort.yml](./examples/bundler.ort.yml)
* [cargo.ort.yml](./examples/cargo.ort.yml)
* [go-dep.ort.yml](./examples/go-dep.ort.yml)
* [go-mod.ort.yml](./examples/go-mod.ort.yml)
* [gradle.ort.yml](./examples/gradle.ort.yml)
* [gradle-android.ort.yml](./examples/gradle-android.ort.yml)
* [maven.ort.yml](./examples/maven.ort.yml)
* [npm.ort.yml](./examples/npm.ort.yml)
* [php-composer.ort.yml](./examples/php-composer.ort.yml)
* [pip.ort.yml](./examples/pip.ort.yml)
* [sbt.ort.yml](./examples/sbt.ort.yml)
* [stack.ort.yml](./examples/stack.ort.yml)
* [yarn.ort.yml](./examples/yarn.ort.yml)

## Curations

### When to Use Curations

Project-specific curations should be used when you want to correct the licenses detected in the source code of the
project. If you need to correct the license findings for a third-party dependency then add a curation to
[curations.yml](config-file-curations-yml.md) or [package configuration](config-file-package-configuration-yml.md).

### Curating License Findings

An `ort scan` result represents the detected licenses as a collection of license findings.
A single `LicenseFinding` is represented as a tuple: `(license id, file path, start line, end line)`.
Applying a `LicenseFindingCuration` changes the license-Id of any `LicenseFinding`
or eliminates the `LicenseFinding` in case the license is set to `NONE`.

As an example, the following curation would replace similar findings of `GPL-2.0-only` with `Apache-2.0` in all `.cpp`
files in the `src` directory:

e.g.:
```yaml
curations:
  license_findings:
  - path: "src/**.cpp"
    start_lines: "3"
    line_count: 11
    detected_license: "GPL-2.0-only"
    reason: "CODE"
    comment: "The scanner matches a variable named `gpl`."
    concluded_license: "Apache-2.0"
 ```

For details of the specification, see 
[LicenseFindingCuration.kt](../model/src/main/kotlin/config/LicenseFindingCuration.kt).
The list of available options for `reason` are defined in
[LicenseFindingCurationReason.kt](../model/src/main/kotlin/config/LicenseFindingCurationReason.kt).

## Resolutions

### When to Use Resolutions
Project-specific resolutions should be used if you are unable to solve an issue by other means.

If a resolution is not project-specific than add it to [resolutions.yml](./config-file-resolutions-yml.md)
so that it is applied to each scan.

### Resolution Basics
Resolutions allow you to *resolve* issues or policy rule violations by marking them as acceptable.
A resolution is applied to specific issues or violations via the regular expression specified
in the `message` of a resolution.

To be able to show why a resolution is acceptable, each resolution must include an explanation. 
The explanation consists of:

* `reason` -- an identifier selected from a predefined list of options. 
* `comment` -- free text, providing an explanation and optionally a link to further information.

### Resolving Issues

If the ORT results show issues, the best approach is usually to fix them and run the scan again.
However, sometimes it is not possible, for example if an issue occurs in the license scan
of a third-party dependency which cannot be fixed or updated.

In such situations, you can *resolve* the issue in any future scan by adding a resolution
to the `.ort.yml` to mark it as acceptable.

The code below shows the structure of an issue resolution in the `.ort.yml` file:

```yaml
resolutions:
  issues:
  - message: "A regular expression matching the error message."
    reason: "One of IssueResolutionReason e.g BUILD_TOOL_ISSUE,CANT_FIX_ISSUE."
    comment: "A comment further explaining why the reason above is acceptable."
```
Where the list of available options for `reason` is defined in
[IssueResolutionReason.kt](../model/src/main/kotlin/config/IssueResolutionReason.kt)

For example, to ignore an issue related to a build tool problem, your `.ort.yml` could include:

```yaml
resolutions:
  issues:
  - message: "Does not have X.*"
    reason: "BUILD_TOOL_ISSUE"
    comment: "Error caused by a known issue for which a fix is being implemented, see https://github.com/..."
```

### Resolving Policy Rule Violations

Resolutions should not be not used to resolve license policy rule violations as they do not change 
the generated open source notices. 
To resolve a license policy rule violation either add a [license finding curation](#curations)
to the .ort.yml file if the finding is in your code repository or add a curation to the
[curations.yml](config-file-curations-yml.md) if the violation occurs in a third-party dependency.

The code below shows the structure of an policy rule violation resolution in the `.ort.yml` file:

```yaml
resolutions:
  rule_violations:
  - message: "A regular expression matching the policy rule violation message."
    reason: "One of RuleViolationResolutionReason e.g. CANT_FIX_EXCEPTION, DYNAMIC_LINKAGE_EXCEPTION."
    comment: "A comment further explaining why the reason above is applicable."
```

Where the list of available options for `reason` is defined in
[RuleViolationResolutionReason.kt](../model/src/main/kotlin/config/RuleViolationResolutionReason.kt).

For example, to confirm you acquired a commercial Qt license for your project, your `.ort.yml` could include:

```yaml
resolutions:
  rule_violations:
  - message: ".*LicenseRef-scancode-qt-commercial-1.1 found in 'third-party/qt/LICENSE'.*"
    reason: "LICENSE_ACQUIRED_EXCEPTION"
    comment: "Commercial Qt license for the project was purchased, for details see https://jira.example.com/issues/SOURCING-5678"
```
